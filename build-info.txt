This application is segmented in frontend/backend, where the frontend is a react application 
and the backend is a FastAPI one.

As FastAPI can serve static files, and the frontent is a single page app, the frontent can be
served by the backend to make deployment one line "uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0"
(or two lines for changing directory first in the daemon bash script)

When deploying, if not using the default fastapi port (8000), you must edit the uri references
within the frontend code

In heating-data.jsx - the API calls need the port changed
In package.json, the home path also needs the port specifed (this handles relative routing)

This could be handled with environment varibales but as there are only two places to make
the change and this project is not likely to grow, it would be overkill for my purposes as
of now.

(with the above statement I have just guaranteed that this software will be in production
forever, become a massive codebase and require regular, painful maintenance for the rest
of my life - lol)
